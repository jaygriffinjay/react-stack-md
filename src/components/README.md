# Components Directory

This directory is for reusable React components. Suggested organization:

- `common/` - Shared components like buttons, inputs, cards
- `layout/` - Layout components like header, footer, sidebar
- `features/` - Feature-specific components
- `ui/` - Pure UI components

Each component should have its own directory with:
- Component file (e.g., `Button.jsx`)
- Styles (if needed)
- Tests
- Index file for clean exports
