# Utils Directory

This directory is for utility functions and helpers. Suggested organization:

- `format/` - Date, number, and string formatting utilities
- `validation/` - Form validation and data validation helpers
- `api/` - API-related utilities (fetch wrappers, error handlers)
- `storage/` - Local storage, session storage helpers
- `constants/` - Application constants and configuration

Each utility should:
- Be pure functions where possible
- Include tests
- Be well-documented
- Be focused on a single responsibility
